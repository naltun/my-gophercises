# Gophercises -- Exercise 1

### What is it?
From [Gophercises.com](https://gophercises.com)...

> Create a program that will read in a quiz provided via a CSV file (more details below) and will then give the quiz to a user keeping track of how many questions they get right and how many they get incorrect. Regardless of whether the answer is correct or wrong the next question should be asked immediately afterwards.
>
> The CSV file should default to problems.csv (example shown below), but the user should be able to customize the filename via a flag.

### What to do?
Run the code with `go run main.go`, and play the game. The game comes with a set of math problems in `problems.csv`, although you can set your own file. If no argument is specified via `-file`, then the game defaults to `problems.csv`.

Good luck!
